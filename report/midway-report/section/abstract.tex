Modern database systems are highly configurable and must support a
wide variety of workloads. However, \textit{tuning} these systems is
challenging. Configuration assistants like Microsoft's AutoAdmin
\citep{agrawal03} allow administrators to use statistics and
suggestions from the database
system to guide the physical design of the database. However, these methods
still require experienced administrators and prior knowledge about the
workload. We seek to apply machine learning methods to automate database
system tuning with minimal user input and knowledge by matching
workloads to representative benchmarks. For this midway
report, we focus on methods and performance of workload matching.
