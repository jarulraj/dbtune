Modern database systems are highly configurable and must support a
wide variety of workloads. However, \textit{tuning} these systems is
challenging. Configuration assistants like Microsoft's AutoAdmin
\citep{agrawal03} allow administrators to use statistics and
suggestions from the database
system to guide the physical design of the database. However, these methods
still require experienced administrators and prior knowledge about the
workload. We apply machine learning methods to automate database
system tuning with minimal user input and knowledge by mapping
workloads to representative benchmarks and then estimating 
performance metrics using a machine learning model without actually 
running the workload.
Our experiments show that a CART-based decision tree classifier
achieves 91\% accuracy on the classification problem.
We also demonstrate that a Gaussian process regression estimator
has a R-squared score of 0.9 for estimating the throughput of
the DBMS while executing a SQL workload under a given
DBMS configuration.
